      <description>When I was taking his class of US foreign economic policy, Professor Kerry Chase asked me to build him a website, which I did.

      <description>Please note - I deeply respect various opinions on the moral wight of abortion, but personally [^1] fully support the right of a woman to make her own judgements about the matter. For that reason, I believe that women should have full knowledge of all of their options when they become pregnant, and that is the aim that this project is directed toward.
[^1] I think most of us would agree that there is a difference in value between the existence of a day-old fertilized human egg, and a pregnancy that is about to be birthed.</description>

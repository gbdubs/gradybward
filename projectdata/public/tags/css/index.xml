      <description>In the third Harry Potter book, Harry is given the “Maurauder’s Map”, and one of the many images I like about this map is how the ink spreads outward from the point that it is awoken.
I wondered if you could do this in CSS, so I poked around, learned about CSS Transitions, and came up with a generalized framework for making a set of boxes animate on to the page.</description>

      <description>Two of my all time favorite books are &amp;ldquo;Measurement&amp;rdquo; by Lockheart and &amp;ldquo;The Elements of Euclid&amp;rdquo; by Byrne. Both take nontraditional approaches to exploring geometry. Part of what is magical about them is the way that they build an intuitive depth that doesn&amp;rsquo;t rely on formalism. This project came to me while trying to fall asleep one night. The code is here. The premise is (I think) much more aptly described by showing intermediate results.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing a lot more golang of late, so I wrote a (gorgeous) visual debugger for helping to do post-hoc debugging. It&amp;rsquo;s been hugely helpful in my lambda based projects, where one often wants the ability to quickly view &amp;ldquo;what happened during this trace&amp;rdquo; without running locally with a traditional step based debugger.
Unlike many of my projects, this one is pretty well supported, and I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to add features as I need them.</description>

      <description>This project is a work in progress, it still has lots of work to be done.
A few years ago, I created a project called VOAT, in which I used a simple space filling algorithm, alongside a variety of different CSS properties to generate goregeous patterns. I recently revisited this project with the intent on showing folks how it was made, and introducing folks to CSS.
The result is a new site, voat.</description>

      <description>In my original website, I wanted to play with the fundamental assumption of what a webpage renders as - a series of nested boxes. The idea of an expanding button that becomes the page facinated me, particularly since the new page had buttons for the old one (I was reading all about golden-braids in GEB at the time).
This isn’t great work, but it reflects where I was at at the time - having fun, experimenting, and learning Javascript.</description>

      <description>I took an architechure class in my Senior Year at Brandeis that awoke an asthetic sense I had not previously identified or listened to. In particular, the de-stijl primitive of intersecting planes struck a resonant chord in my sense of beauty.
That new asthetic, in combination with “draw me CSS” was the inspiration for V2 of my website - meant to resemble something in between a circut board, the maurader’s map, and the de-stijl classic “Composition in black, red, yellow and blue”.</description>

      <description>When I tried to update my website in December of 2017, I couldn’t find the files anywhere on my laptop or github. This was a surprise, but one that I took as an opporotunity to recreate the site from scratch, using best practices from the start, and making some design changes. Luckily I later found these files, and posted them as V2 on this page.
The result is the site you see before you - with a detailed portfolio section, some nice hugo-templated HTML, and the cute animations (which are NOT generated via draw-me-css).</description>

      <description>In disagreements around the appropriate use of and justified restriction on technology (tech-use), you will rarely find compromise or gradation. I think this is because we lack a nuanced vocabulary to grapple with tech-use. Unlike other types ethical questions, tech-use doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a storied history of thought experiments, historical error and fallacies to guide our reasoning. In addition, reducing tech-use questions to moral ones typically involves lots of assumptions, examples and hand waving, and with that much subjectivity, the conclusion is likely more indicative of the chosen translation than of an actual moral parallel.</description>

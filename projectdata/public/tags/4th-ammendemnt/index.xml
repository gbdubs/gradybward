      <description>Justice Kagan&amp;rsquo;s decision in Florida v. Harris articulates a few principles on which we can build effective privacy preserving tools for law enforcement. In the unanimous decision, the court ruled that the indication of a Drug Sniffing Dog was grounds for search under the fourth amendment. In doing so, the court held up the drug sniffing dog as an exemplar of privacy preserving law enforcement tooling. It&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile extracting a few lessons from the court&amp;rsquo;s reasoning in considering the design of what makes a dog&amp;rsquo;s nose, in contrast to most digital technology, such a satisfying balance of rights and state interests.</description>

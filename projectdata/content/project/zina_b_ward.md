Over christmas break, I got frusturated with my sisterâ€™s incredibly specific asks from a wordpress template, so I [built her a website instead](http://zinabward.com/index.html). 

After a brief period of haggling over the acceptable level of bells and whilstles (I wanted more), we came to a resonable design consensus, and I implemented the site and fine tuned it with its owner in about five hours.

Scroll down past the menu to see some fun. At some point I'll learn non-vanilla JavaScript, but it wasn't for this project.

If you haven’t yet listened to Janelle Monae’s “Metropolis” suite, drop all the committments you can, pour yourself some coffee and wine, and listen to it straight through. 

Monae is a magician, a siren, an entertainer, a theorist, a historian, and a visionary. Metropolis helped me understand so much about so much that talking about it here will certainly do it an injustice. If you are interested, check out my 2016 term paper on her work within the context of historical waves of Black Feminism. Or, more realisitically, read one of the many articles by people who know her work better than me about why it is the best music and art from the last decade. 

Within the context of this project, one of the questions Monae raises is about the intersection of technology, humanity and art. Cindi is an attempt to programmatically generate art that evokes real human emotion. To understand this full ambition, check out the page itself.

This was an expansion of the work in VOAT - rather than using squares with a predictible and pre-defined set of ports to connect, I use polygons with arbitrarily defined sub-regions. The results are wild: extreme variance, never dull.  To see how some of these were generated, check out the tesselation photos here. 

I’ve since used the patterns from CINDI to create some scarves for my family.  Photos Attached. 

I hope to do more work in this space, and would love to see these patterns in more places. I would ideally like to encorporate images, create non-fluid spacefilling, create classifications for common aesthetic patterns and entropy filters to filter out boring or repetitive generations. I hope this project goes somewhere, but I need time to work on it.

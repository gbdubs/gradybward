In my original website, I wanted to play with the fundamental assumption of what a webpage renders as - a series of nested boxes.  The idea of an expanding button that becomes the page facinated me, particularly since the new page had buttons for the old one (I was reading all about golden-braids in GEB at the time).

This isnâ€™t great work, but it reflects where I was at at the time - having fun, experimenting, and learning Javascript.

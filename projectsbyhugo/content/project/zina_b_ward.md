Over christmas break, I got frusturated with my sisterâ€™s incredibly specific asks from a wordpress template, so I built her a website instead. 

After a brief period of haggling over the acceptable level of bells and whilstles (I wanted more), we came to a resonable design consensus, and I implemented the site and fine tuned it with its owner in about five hours.

Maddie Dollins is a dear friend who is frequently frustratingly indecisive. 

One night at dinner she asked if she should have chocolate milk - to which I said “I do not care”. She then asked if she should have regular milk. This broke the camel’s back, and in a rush of an hour, I built and published WSMD - What Should Maddie Do - a simplified magic-eight-ball that simply returns a yes or no.

No frills, basic code, cute styles.

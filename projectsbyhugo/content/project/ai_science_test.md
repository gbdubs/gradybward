This project is not very exciting.

For an ML projectin in my AI class, we were assigned a task from Kaggle - answering multiple choice questions from a ninth grade science test. Tensor flow had been released a week beforehand, and I used it out of the box (with slight model refactoring) to train an ML model for the competition. Ours did really well - top 10 out of 500 contenders.

Thanks Tensor Flow!

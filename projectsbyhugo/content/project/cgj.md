In it's state constitution, California defines a unique institution for each county called the *Civil Grand Jury*, which is tasked with overseeing the effectiveness and efficiency of the county's governance.

I volunteered to be on [San Francisco's Civil Grand Jury](http://civilgrandjury.sfgov.org/) for the 2017-18 term, and began working with the Jury in September of 2017.  Though all jury proceedings operate under confidentiality, I can say that I have chaired up an investigative committee, and that we will be releasing a report in July.

I learned so much from this experience: managing a team of folks with wildly different skillsets and focuses, doing meticulously detailed researching and interviewing, and having a large number of tasks to juggle at every moment.

When the reports are made public, I will link to it here.

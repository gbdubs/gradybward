      <description>Professor Linda Bui is a gem who really helped me enjoy my economics degree at Brandeis. So when she asked me if I could scrape all birth certificates from 1900 to 1950 in Massachusetts, I said “maybe”, rather than “no”.
I ended up using matlab to do OCR with a combination of models. The forms were either hand written or were machine printed, and I generated seperate models for each. The full accuracy of the system (having zero errors on the 21 fields) was about 40%.</description>

      <description>In it&amp;rsquo;s state constitution, California defines a unique institution for each county called the Civil Grand Jury, which is tasked with overseeing the effectiveness and efficiency of the county&amp;rsquo;s governance.
I volunteered to be on San Francisco&amp;rsquo;s Civil Grand Jury for the 2017-18 term, and began working with the Jury in September of 2017. Though all jury proceedings operate under confidentiality, I can say that I have chaired up an investigative committee, and that we will be releasing a report in July.</description>

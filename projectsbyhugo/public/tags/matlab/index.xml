      <description>Professor Linda Bui is a gem who really helped me enjoy my economics degree at Brandeis. So when she asked me if I could scrape all birth certificates from 1900 to 1950 in Massachusetts, I said “maybe”, rather than “no”.
I ended up using matlab to do OCR with a combination of models. The forms were either hand written or were machine printed, and I generated seperate models for each. The full accuracy of the system (having zero errors on the 21 fields) was about 40%.</description>

      <description>I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the Graph Isomorphism problem, and within that, the “Paths” invariant, which is incredibly powerful test for discerning between potentially isomorphic graphs in cubic (and fully paralellizable) time.
The main findings of my thesis were that: Unlike was theorized by XXX, copaths graphs exist, and finding them is easily done through some mapreduces, or on a GPU. Measuring discriminatory power to value ratio of invariants within graph isomorphism is possible and can help us devise better algorithms for practical isomorphism detection.</description>

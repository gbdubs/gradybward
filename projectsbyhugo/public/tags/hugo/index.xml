      <description>When I tried to update my website in December of 2017, I couldnâ€™t find the files anywhere on my laptop or github. This was a surprise, but one that I took as an opporotunity to recreate the site from scratch, using best practices from the start, and making some design changes. Luckily I later found these files, and posted them as V2 on this page.
The result is the site you see before you - with a detailed portfolio section, some nice hugo-templated HTML, and the cute animations (which are NOT generated via draw-me-css).</description>

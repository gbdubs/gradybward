      <description>In my time at Brandeis University, I spent 3 years working hard for the Brandeis Student Union. Over those three years, we had three different computer science students as “web-master”, and three politicos as “communications director”. The problem was that each “web-master” would build a beautiful website that was never able to be updated because the communications director never had the technical expertiese to update the HTML or use the static site generator.</description>

      <description>Comment threads are an inherently flawed way to have a discussion, because they are strictly linear. In recent years, large organizations like facebook have realized this and have tried to reconsile it with a binary tree pattern of deeper or next. This only partially solves the problem. Far more frequently, if I want to respond to a comment, there are multiple peices of it that I want to respond to, and some may already be addressed further down the thread.</description>
